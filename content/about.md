## Author’s Note

I’ve always been expressive—one way or another. And that’s one of the reasons I started writing in the first place.

Over time, being expressive has made me realize the importance of stories.
It’s insane how one story can make you laugh, change your mood, or even inspire you for life. Remember Bran Stark from Game of Thrones? The Night King wanted to kill him because ending him meant erasing all the stories of humanity—and that’s how you kill mankind.
 (Also, let’s be honest, even if you didn’t care much for Bran’s storyline, you’ve got to admit that part was pretty deep.)

>!highlight!<What are we if not for stories?>


 We’re constantly crafting them—through our lives, our choices, our conversations. We’re obsessed with stories, whether they come as shows, movies, books, or just the random things our friends tell us.
 (Especially the ones that start with “Don’t tell anyone, but—” those are the best kinds of stories.)

That’s the intention behind this blog. Since stories have so much power, I want to share mine and the stories I know with as many people as I can.

As a reader, I look for escape when I read. And sometimes, that escape feels even better when it’s a little away from reality. For a moment, it’s nice to believe in things that may not be possible in real life—but exist in that story, in that world.

But as a writer, I don’t want to create something far from reality. I want to be honest about what I feel and talk about real things. Because yes, real life is messy and screwed up—but it’s also beautiful because of its chaos.

And very few people talk about that honestly. I genuinely want to be one of them.
 Like Taylor Swift says, “If this was a movie, you’d be here by now.”
 >!highlight!<But it's not a movie—and I want to write about what it's like when you're not here.>

 (Cue dramatic background music and a tub of ice cream.)

Also, a small disclaimer: I’m not a great writer (yet), but I’m aspiring to be one.
 (So, if you catch a typo, let’s just call it creative expression, okay?)
