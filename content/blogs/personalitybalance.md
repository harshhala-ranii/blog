Before we even get to personalities, here’s one thing I’ve learned the hard and soft way: the people you keep around you matter. Friends, acquaintances, those one-conversation connections you think are “nothing serious”, they shape your world more than you realise. The right people inspire you, introduce you to ideas you’d never find on your own, and show up with company or clarity exactly when you need it.

And attracting the right crowd?  
It’s not luck, it’s not extroversion, and it’s definitely not about having a perfect life. It’s about the *tiny signals* your personality sends out without you noticing — signals that decide who approaches you, who stays, and who quietly walks away.

And that’s where this little tip comes in.

I’m just sharing the little personality wisdom I’ve collected, tested, mildly failed at, re-tested, and finally learned to adapt. And honestly? It’s… sort of working. Fairly. On most days. So consider this your friendly guide to having a personality that helps you attract the right people.

>!highlight!<The secret involves two simple things: warmth and competence.>!highlight!<

Warmth is basically the weather forecast of your personality. It’s how kind you are, how friendly and lively you seem, and whether people feel like they can sit next to you without regretting their life choices. Warm people are comforting to be around — they make others feel welcomed, included, and slightly less dead inside. Everyone loves a warm presence.

But here’s the twist: too much warmth and you become the designated “fun, chill, nice vibe” friend with absolutely zero other utility. Great to hang out with, great to call during emotional crises, great for sending memes… but no one sees you as someone who brings anything beyond comfort. No edge, no takeaway, just pure serotonin. The human equivalent of a scented candle — lovely, but replaceable.

Now enter competence. Competence is simply being good at what you do — actually knowing stuff, delivering, being sharp, pulling your life together at least 60% of the time. Competence earns respect, the real kind. People look at you and think, “Yes, this person has a functional brain.” And they’re right. Respect can’t be demanded, but competence hands it to you on a silver plate.

But overdose on competence with zero warmth and suddenly you’re the intimidating, slightly robotic person no one wants to casually talk to. People admire you… from a safe distance, like an exhibit in a museum. You look smart, capable, responsible — but also unapproachable. You become the “I’ll only talk to them if my life depends on it” type. The nerd aura intensifies. Everyone respects you, but no one wants to grab coffee with you.

The real magic is in balancing both — being warm enough for people to actually like being around you, but competent enough for them to respect you. It’s a deadly combo. Someone who’s friendly, kind, and fun, but also sharp and reliable, is basically irresistible. They’re the person people flock to, trust, listen to, and genuinely enjoy. Warmth gets people to come closer; competence makes them stay.

So if you feel like you don't have the right people around you, maybe it’s not a mystery after all. Maybe you’re too nice with nothing to offer. Or too capable with no human softness. Or maybe you’re simply excelling at repelling social interaction — in which case, honestly, iconic.

All jokes aside,be a little kinder if you’re all brain and no heart. Be a little sharper if you’re all heart and no backbone.
