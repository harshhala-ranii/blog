It’s the perfect morning. Just like every morning. You wake up with a smile that feels natural, effortless, as though your face was designed just for this life. And why wouldn’t it be? You are living the exact dream you scribbled in school notebooks, right down to the smallest detail. On your wall, a picture of you flying a toy airplane sits beside another photo: you in crisp pilot uniform, grinning on Graduation Day. Past and present, framed in harmony. You are extraordinary.

This is the Perfect World \- a place where dreams bloom exactly the way you imagined them. Every child who once said “I want to be a pilot\!” or “I want to be a dancer\!” grows into that vision. Doctors who never doubted their path. Painters who never had to justify their art. Engineers who always believed they would solve big problems. No one ends up in a job they never wanted. No confusion, no sacrifice. Only fulfillment.There is no problem of money, or society or any other obstacle that keeps you away from your dream career.

Still glowing from this thought, you wander into the kitchen and tug the fridge open. Empty shelves greet you. No milk, no vegetables, not even that block of cheese you swear you kept. You frown. You definitely ordered groceries for the morning. Maybe the delivery person is simply late. Happens.And everything in your house is dirty, the laundry clothes are still there,the utensils unwashed, it appears like your maid is not here yet. “Gowri aunty\!”you call out, no reply whatsoever. You want to call her but you are already late, so you decide to deal with this later and quickly get ready to go to work.

 You shrug from all the frustration as you lock the door to head out , it's nothing a café coffee can’t fix. The barista you like is on the way. A blessed accident.

The lift ride down is too quiet. The liftman isn’t there today, no smile, no “Good morning madam,” no tiny chat about last night’s match or the city’s constant construction. You ride down in an uncomfortable silence that clings to your skin.

When you step out of the building, a massive billboard stuns you. Manish \-your liftman is on it, wearing stylish sunglasses, posing like a celebrity.  
 **“New Music Album Releasing Friday\!”**

You blink. Manish? Album?  
 The world tilts a little, but you blame your lack of caffeine and keep walking wondering if he has a doppelganger.

The streets outside feel strange.  
 No autos weaving through traffic. No taxis honking impatiently.  
 No cycle repair stalls opening shutters.No newspaper vendors.  
 No street vendors calling out for customers.No school buses.  
 Just… nothing.

But there’s trash everywhere. Piles of it. No sanitation workers sweeping. No municipal staff hauling bins.A knot forms in your stomach.

Inside the café, there are people, which calms you. Until you look behind the counter. No barista. No helpers. No kitchen staff. Only the owner, running between tasks, eyes tired and frantic.

When you ask where the workers are, she gives you a look that borders on disbelief.

“Workers? Why would anyone work for me? Owning this café is *my* dream. Why would someone else dream of being a cashier? Or a cleaner? Or washing dishes all day? In the Perfect World, everyone lives *their* dream, not someone else’s.”

And suddenly your entire morning makes sense.

There was no delivery because there was no delivery person.  
 No one dreams of waking before sunrise, driving through traffic, and hauling crates to strangers’ doorsteps.There were no autos because no one dreams of driving one all day.

 No sanitation workers because no child grows up saying they want to sweep streets.  
 No school bus drivers.No plumbers. No electricians.  
 No tailors. No security guards sitting through the night shift.  
 No mechanics.No masons.No newspaper printers.  
 No gardeners.No carpenters.  
 No one who does the quiet, unglamorous work that allows the world to breathe.

You sip your coffee, hands trembling, as the truth sinks in:  
>!highlight!<The world is built on the shoulders of people whose dreams were never glamorous, yet whose work keeps everything alive.>!highlight!<

The city feels wrong as you walk.  
Shops half-open.Roads are broken.  
Traffic signals dead.A world filled with people who dreamed big, but none who kept the basics running. Everyone standing at the top.  
No one is holding the bottom.

Who repairs leaking pipes? Who collects garbage?  
Who runs buses? Who fixes electrical lines during storms?  
Who cooks in tiny dhabas at 6 AM? Who drives ambulances?  
Who packs groceries in supermarkets? Who manages petrol pumps?

A civilisation without these people isn’t a civilisation. It’s a fragile shell pretending to be perfect.You try to step over a pothole, but it’s deeper than you expect. You stumble and fall, concrete rushing toward your face—

You jerk awake with a scream.

Your heart races as your fingers fly to your nose — it’s okay. Your room looks normal again. Real. Imperfect. Alive.

The doorbell rings.

A delivery guy stands outside, balancing your grocery bags, exhausted but smiling. You thank him sincerely, more sincerely than you ever have and he nods and continues his day. A day filled with a thousand small tasks no one applauds him for.

And suddenly you understand something with absolute clarity:

There is no Perfect World.  There is only this world.

>!highlight!<And this world survives because millions of “ordinary” people do extraordinary things quietly, consistently, invisibly — not because they dreamed of it, but because the world needs them.>!highlight!<

For the first time, you see them.  Really see them.

*The people we call ordinary are the ones who shine brighter than any dream ever could.*
