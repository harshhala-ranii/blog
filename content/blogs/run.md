No offense, but running is the only chaos that actually calms my brain."

Sometimes, all I need is to get away into the mountains or somewhere close to nature to find peace. But that’s not possible every day when you have office, college, and other priorities. You can’t just text your boss, *“Hey, I’m off to the Himalayas for mental peace.”*

There are moments when you need peace in the middle of your daily life , just a pause where nothing matters, where you can step away from everything.

That’s exactly what I found while running.

It’s strange how chaotic running is. You’re panting to catch your breath, your legs ache, every part of your body hurts, and yet, in that moment, my mind goes blank. Nothing that worries me matters anymore. Whatever problems I’m facing simply fade away.No thoughts, no overthinking, just one thought that *I need to run.*

>!highlight!<Why spend money on alcohol when you can forget your problems by running for free?>!highlight!<

At that moment, nothing else matters. No priorities, no people, no thoughts. It’s just me and my legs, one step after another, keeping pace.

Now that I think of it, that numb feeling is what I’ve become addicted to. It’s what gets me out of bed every morning. That feeling keeps me disciplined no matter how sad, angry, or unmotivated I feel. I know it’s going to be worth it.

There was one day when I wanted to go running so badly, but it was raining heavily. I decided to wait and run in the evening instead. When I finished work early, it started raining again. I thought I might have to skip it, but I wasn’t having a great day and just wanted to get away from everything. So I thought, you know what, forget the rain.

I remembered that scene from *Bhaag Milkha Bhaag* where everyone leaves the track when it starts raining, but Milkha keeps running while everyone stares at him. I thought, if he could push through the rain to reach where he did, I can too. I put on my raincoat, drove to the tracks, and started running. To my surprise, I wasn’t alone, there were two or three others running as well. That moment, running in the rain, felt priceless. It was something no beach, mountain, or drink could replace.

Another thing that keeps me running is how it builds my confidence. 
>!highlight!<There are times when I feel underconfident about doing something, but when I complete my run, when I hit the distance I aimed for, it makes me feel like I can achieve anything.>!highlight!<
That confidence carries into everything else: my career, my goals, even how I see myself.

People say running is more psychological than physical, and I completely agree. It’s about the will to keep going when every part of your body is screaming in pain. Isn’t that exactly what success feels like? For that one hour, running becomes a simulation of life. If I can push through that pain, I can push through any tough day or failure.

Just because running gives me solace and confidence doesn’t mean it has to be the same for you. But if you’re reading this, maybe it’s a sign to find your own version of it — something that gives you peace and confidence like running gives me. Trips to nature might bring peace, and alcohol might give temporary escape, but finding something healthy that gives you lasting solace is a real flex.

I even did a half marathon just three to four months after I started running, and that boosted my confidence like nothing else.

**“Soi takdiirein jaga denge,**  
 **Kal ko ambar bhi jhuka denge,**  
 **Haan, hai jazba.”**

-Manja 

This song was playing in my head when I finished my half marathon.Okay, maybe I was too tired to sing, but mentally, full music video mode.

Everyone is running these days, especially in Bangalore. Almost every area has a run club, and I’m part of the Indiranagar Run Club. There was a 5K run organized by them once, and not wanting to embarrass myself there is what got me to start running in the first place. And now, I am a run lead there\! 

These run clubs and Strava reels on Instagram make it easier to stay motivated and find people who share the same energy.

When you don’t feel like running anymore, sometimes it’s the people around you or your crush watching, which, let’s be honest, is the best kind of motivation. You can’t just stop running mid-track and look uncool.

So if you’re thinking of starting to run, this is the best time. You won’t find this kind of motivation again.

The one thing you should know about running is that consistency isn’t easy. There are good days and bad ones. One day you can run long distances with ease, and the next, even half that distance feels impossible. So don’t worry about the pace or the kilometers. Just keep showing up.

*That’s what consistency really means — not how fast or how far you go, but that you show up anyway.*
