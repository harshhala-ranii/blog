Albert Einstein once said, “I am neither clever nor exceptionally gifted. I am only very, very curious.” He meant curiosity in science, of course—but what about people like us? The ones who aren’t curious about just one thing, but about *everything*. The ones who can’t stay in one lane because there are too many lanes, too many roads, too many possibilities that look exciting.

I was never a child prodigy. I was never “Olympiad level” good at anything. And honestly, I’ve made peace with that. Because while I may not have one towering, singular talent, I do have a handful of things I love—and I know that my life is never going to be about just one of them. 

Maybe one day I’ll find that one thing and go deep into it. But realistically? I know myself. I’ll probably find two or three things and keep getting better at all of them. That’s what drives me. That’s what gives me adrenaline. Doing just one thing forever would bore me to death.

Imagine your life as the kind of main-character montage you see in an ad or a movie. You wake up early and go for a run. You hit the gym. You dress up, go to the office. After work, you head to a government school and teach a few kids. Then you come back home and do something that lights you up—reading, dancing, gaming, writing, anything. 

Tell me that doesn’t look fun. Tell me that doesn’t feel like a life worth waking up to.

Of course you’ll be tired. Of course it’s a lot. But you’ll also be building a life you’re excited about. Even if your day job isn’t your passion, if you fill your life with things beyond that job, you’ll have something to look forward to every single day.

>!highlight!<We’ve all heard the quote, “Jack of all trades, master of none.” What people conveniently skip is the full line: “But oftentimes better than master of one.”>!highlight!< 

Being curious about many things isn’t a weakness. It’s range. It’s adaptability. It’s the courage to not limit yourself just because the world tells you to pick one box and stay inside it.

I remember one HR interviewer telling me, “You’ve explored everything horizontally. Now it’s time to explore something vertically.” And maybe that’s true—for some people, at some stage. But you don’t have to force yourself to go vertical before you’re ready. Before you’ve experimented enough. Before you’ve tasted enough. Before you know what’s worth choosing.

There’s absolutely nothing wrong with focusing on one thing. But if you’re someone who finds excitement in doing multiple things, if you’re not exceptionally gifted in any one direction but endlessly curious in many—then there is absolutely nothing wrong with that either. Especially in your 20s. This decade is meant for trying. For saying yes. For exploring everything possible until you figure out what feels right.

Your curiosity is your permission. So try the thing. Try all the things. Let yourself become a mosaic instead of a single brushstroke.
