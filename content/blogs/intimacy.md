With the internet drowning in articles like *“10 Ways to Please Your Man”*, here’s something refreshing: an honest, woman-to-woman (and yes, man-friendly) talk about **female desire**.  
 This article is stitched together from conversations with a few women, the kind of unfiltered chats people usually reserve for 2 AM sleepovers. Consider this your guide to actually understanding what women want… and what they *don’t*.

## **1\. “I was intimate with my partner once and… didn’t like it.”**

Let’s be real — the first kiss, or the first *anything*, is rarely straight out of a movie. Nobody's suddenly a Greek God or Goddess with perfect rhythm and zero awkwardness. More like:  
 *“Oh god, where do I put my hands?”*  
 *“Whose nose bumped into whose?”*  
 *“Is my hair in his mouth?”*

Totally normal.

Comfort in intimacy isn’t instant; it’s like a new pair of jeans \- stiff at first, but gets better as you wear it. As you spend more time with someone, you stop thinking about your breathing pattern and start focusing on… well, the fun stuff.

And here's the twist: what turns you on when you watch porn may not do the same in real life. There are things that look hot, but not necessarily hot when you do it with your partner, get this straight,buddy.

Like they say (and your aunties would faint if they heard it), **“Practice makes it less awkward… and eventually, kinda amazing.”**

You learn your partner.You learn their spots. You learn their likes and dislikes.  
 You learn yourself too in the process.  
 And suddenly, things you once thought were “meh” become “oh… OH\!”

There are times you can get really conscious about, and even feel insecure about your body. But, that gets better with time, once you start trusting your partner better.

To sum this up, it takes time for an intimate experience to feel good and less awkward, so yes, have patience and trust the process.

## **2\. “Am I really ready?”**

If men get a very visible signal when they’re turned on (yes, the small brother rises), women have their own built-in indicator: **lubrication**.  
 And not like a cute sprinkle. We’re talking actual *hydration levels*, okay? Nature went all out here.

But here’s where things get tricky. Sometimes you’re making out, everything feels great, your mind says “YES,” yet you are not wet enough down there.

Not being wet enough is not a moral failure. It’s not “OMG I’m broken.”  
 It’s your body saying, *“I love that you’re excited, but I am not ready yet”*

Trying to push through without enough lubrication? You will have intense pain and a burning sensation down there, and of course you don’t want that.

A lot of this confusion comes from porn \- where everyone looks magically ready in 0.5 seconds. Real life? Not that efficient. A fairly good amount of foreplay until you have enough lubrication is always recommended.

Stress, overthinking, your menstrual cycle, hormones, or even being tired can make your body slow to respond. At times like this, it is suggested to use lube, so that you need not worry about 

## **3\. “Is your girlfriend faking it?”**

Let’s talk orgasms. 

Here’s the truth many men don’t know (and many women don’t say):  
 **Most women do NOT orgasm through penetration alone.**  
 Not because they don’t enjoy it — penetration is great\!  
 But the clitoris, that tiny powerhouse, has **as many nerve endings as a penis**. Nature literally gave us a VIP switch. Use it.

Porn lies.  
 Porn says women hit the ceiling the moment penetration happens.  
 Real life says: “Bro… no.”

If you’re a man reading this and thinking:  
 *“Wait… so what do I do?”*  
 Relax. Women aren't asking you to solve the Da Vinci Code — just use your hands, your mouth, your creativity, and most importantly, **your ears**. Communicate. Play. Learn.

And to the women:  
 Stop faking.  
 You are not doing anybody a favour by performing like you're in an acting audition.  
 Tell him what works. Guide him. Move his hand like you’re adjusting a toddler’s crayon grip.

*Intimacy is personal.* 
*No two women are the same — so why are we all pretending the same “movie script” works?*
